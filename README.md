# stock-analysis
## VBA Challenge

## This project will include a deeper research for Steve's stock dataset over the last few year. 

### Our goal is to be able to run different analysis report for the entire dataset through VBA coding and optimize our time for any process.

## Analysis and Challenges

### After analyzing the data that Steve had in his Dataset we can see big differences between 2017 and 2018 for each stock. Most of the stocks had a negative Return in 2018 and are currently negative in 2018. Only 2 stocks performed better in 2018 than in 2017 and they were TERP (that is still negative but better than 2017) and RUN that had a better Return in 2018 than 2017.

### The biggest challenge was gathering all the code together and debugging each step of the challenge. I bumped into many issues but managed to get the code finalized to conclude the analysis requested. 

## Results

To conclude we can see that 2017 had better return than 2018 for almost all the stocks in Steves dataset and that Steve will have to check on different stocks and do more research in the market to find a better investment options.
